# 🔍 Analysis of Women Safety in India Using Instagram Data

This project analyzes public sentiment regarding women's safety issues in India by analyzing Instagram comments using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
It provides a simple **GUI using Tkinter** to:

- Visualize images
- Read Instagram comments from CSV files
- Clean the comments
- Perform sentiment analysis using **TextBlob**
- Display sentiment results using **Matplotlib charts**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** — for GUI development
- **Pandas** — for CSV data handling
- **TextBlob** — for sentiment analysis
- **NLTK** — for stop words removal
- **Pillow (PIL)** — for image processing
- **Matplotlib** — for data visualization

---
## 🔧Required libraries
```
pip install pandas textblob pillow matplotlib nltk
```
---

## Run the Python script
```
python women_safety_analysis.py
```
---

## Steps in the Application:
- Select a category (Rape, Stalking, etc.) from the dropdown.
- Load images related to the selected category.
- Read Instagram comments from the CSV file.
- Clean the comments using NLP.
- Analyze the comments' sentiment using TextBlob.
- View the sentiment distribution in a pie chart.
